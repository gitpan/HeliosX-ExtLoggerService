HeliosX-ExtLoggerService version 0.02
=====================================

HeliosX::ExtLoggerService is a Helios::Service subclass providing a 
more advanced logging subsystem to Helios applications.  It overrides 
the Helios::Service->logMsg() method with a new, more advanced method. 
It also provides a standard base class, HeliosX::Logger, that can be 
extended to write interface shims to various logging systems.  The 
logging to these systems can be controlled through several new 
helios.ini options globally or on an application-by-application basis.
